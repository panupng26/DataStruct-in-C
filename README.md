### My project in the part myself learning about Data Structure

- Has basic in c vairable and syntax in c language in Functional programing such as For Loop, while loop, if condition, switchcase, printf, scanf
- So my project having self help improve my logic skill and I'm pratice every week that i think if who seen this my project and pratice step to step in topic in week i think you'll improve you skill in functional sure
- this project Having about of Data structure a lot of trick back to the basic it will help improve your structure in programing used your work in project such as 
 - Week1 -> 2D Arrays => how to used and used something for improve math or get data 2D
 - Week2 -> Struct in c => this week will improve you structure basic how to used and get data basic a lot
 - Week3 ->Array of struct  => When I learned in sturct i would learned struct a lot of and implement used of Array this week you'll seen my improve struct a lot
 - Week4 -> Array of struct and pointer => Actually, at that time I crossed the learn at week 5 before for learn week4 because learned about pointer is ? why used pointer implement coding for what ?
 - Week5 -> Pointer
 - Week6 -7 -> Linklist => this is very love to this struct i will very fun learned in this struct because linklist will give your data link to data node before and node after how to link why link for what?
 - Week8 - 10-> Stack => i will learned stack just a little in struct and has workshop prefix code something i don't remember
 - Week11 - 12 -> Queue & recursion => it is very simple in function recursive and Queue this week learned a lot of pros and cons in recursive function or it called recursion
 - Week13- 14 -> a lot of Binary, BST=> Binary Search three a lot of I'm very love it so has how to find data in 3 types i don't remember it you can seen

# Editor in past May be i would used DevC++ it is very simple maybe if you want learn i don't care editor because every editor can learned up too you if you will learn it
